# Chatapp-Web
The chat app is a web-based platform designed for secure messaging, similar to WhatsApp. Users can communicate with others who are also registered on the platform.
The app prioritizes security by implementing OTP (One-Time Password) validation during login to ensure user authenticity. The OTP messages are sent via Twilio, providing a reliable and secure method for verification.

This platform offers end-to-end encryption for all messages, ensuring that conversations remain private and secure, just like other popular chat apps.
